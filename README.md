## One Time Pad cryptography toolkit - "otp" command

```
🫡 The only unbreakable cryptographic algorithm (today and forever)
```

This program allows you to operate using one time pad cipher and a keychain. It takes stdin, xor's it with one-time-pad key material held in a keychain of contacts, and outputs the result to stdout.

When using the one time pad algorithm, it is critical to remember to never reuse the part of the key that was used. The keychain enforces this automatically: every encrypt/decrypt consumes its key bytes and physically destroys them, so a spent key range can never serve a second message.

## Features

- **Keychain:** stores key material for any number of contacts under `.keychain/`, one self-contained set of files per contact - see [Keychain Management Commands](#keychain-management-commands).
- **Automatic contact metadata handling:** sequence numbers, key offsets and timestamps are tracked per contact in `<contact>.meta`, read fresh under lock and self-healed against the key file's own size rather than trusted blindly - see [Per-contact metadata files](#per-contact-metadata-files) and [Self-healing metadata](#self-healing-metadata).
- **Simultaneous send/receive, one key pair per contact:** an `_enc.key` and a separate `_dec.key` per contact mean the two directions consume independent key ranges and never block on each other - see [Two keys per contact, mirrored between the two parties](#two-keys-per-contact-mirrored-between-the-two-parties).
- **Protection against concurrent access to the same contact:** an exclusive per-contact `flock()` on `<contact>.lock` serializes any two processes that touch the same contact at once, so they can never draw from the same key range - see [Per-contact locking](#per-contact-locking).
- **Protection against key reuse via disk commit stages:** every message is staged, `fsync`'d and read back verified before anything is published, and the key file is committed *before* the metadata that could otherwise claim it spent early - see [Stages of one encrypt/decrypt operation](#stages-of-one-encryptdecrypt-operation).
- **Automatic recovery from a mid-operation crash:** the next call on a contact reconciles any leftover pending artifact against the key file and metadata via a deterministic truth table - never a guess - before doing anything else - see [Recovering from a crash](#recovering-from-a-crash).
- **Recovery of the last message when delivery isn't acknowledged:** the exact bytes last sent or received are kept in `.last_sent`/`.last_received` until the next confirmed operation, and can be re-emitted at any time with `--recover-last` - see [`--recover-last`: re-emitting the kept safety copies](#--recover-last-re-emitting-the-kept-safety-copies).
- **Origin and order verification:** every decrypt proves, before a single key byte is spent, that the message really comes from this contact's mirrored key and is exactly the next one expected - replayed, reordered, foreign or corrupted messages are rejected with a distinct exit code per failure combination and the keys untouched. Achieved through an encrypted per-message metadata block: each ciphertext opens with a `source_id` (a 128-bit chunk of the key itself, which only the true correspondent can possess), the message's sequence number and its key offset, and decryption validates all three against its own key state - see [Origin and order verification](#origin-and-order-verification).
- **Randomness vault:** `--add-rand-to-vault <size_in_MB>` stores a sequential randomness stream at `.keychain/_randomness` - created (mode 0600) on first use, appended to on every call after, not tied to any contact.

## New key pair generation

Use the `-nk` or `--new-key-pair` flag to generate a new key pair from a source of randomness. Each party receives 2 keys, an encryption key (used for sending messages) and a decryption key (used to receive messages). Each party's pair is written into its own directory, `<name>_keys/`, ready to hand over as one unit, and each file is named for the correspondent it is used with:

```
alice_keys/
   encryption_for_bob.key     <-- the key Alice uses to encrypt messages sent to Bob
   decryption_from_bob.key    <-- the key Alice uses to decrypt messages received from Bob

bob_keys/
   encryption_for_alice.key   <-- the key Bob uses to encrypt messages sent to Alice
   decryption_from_alice.key  <-- the key Bob uses to decrypt messages received from Alice
```

Example (generates 2 key pairs of 1MB length, one pair for each party)
```
cat /dev/urandom | otp --new-key-pair 1 alice bob
```

The key material is read from **stdin**, so the randomness source must be piped in. Run without a pipe (stdin on a terminal), the command no longer refuses outright - it checks `.keychain/_randomness`, the randomness vault filled by [`--add-rand-to-vault`](#keychain-management-commands), instead. Generating a pair needs two independent pads of `<size_in_MB>` each, so the vault must hold at least twice that:

- **Vault holds enough** (>= `2 x <size_in_MB>`): prompts `Use randomness vault for key generation? [y/N]`. Answering `y` draws the two pads from the front of the vault - through the exact same crash-safe stage/verify/publish-then-truncate machinery a contact's key file gets consumed by on every encrypt/decrypt (see [Crash-safe key consumption](#crash-safe-key-consumption)), so an interrupted run is always safely resumable on a later retry with the same size and party names, never by silently drawing fresh vault bytes on top. Answering anything else (including just Enter) cancels with `Operation canceled` and leaves the vault untouched.
- **Vault missing, empty, or holds less than needed**: refuses immediately, the same way a bare terminal always did, and suggests piping in randomness:
  ```
  There is no randomness vault size above 1 bit, please provide randomness via stdin
  Example: cat /dev/urandom | otp --new-key-pair <size_in_MB> <part_a_name> <part_b_name>
  ```

Either way, nothing is created until the randomness source (piped stdin or the vault) is settled.

**The roles are inverted between the two parties**. This is the single most important thing to understand about generation, and getting it backwards is the most common way to end up unable to decrypt anything.

**Only two random keys are actually generated.** The command reads two independent chunks from stdin - call them **Key 1** and **Key 2** - and writes each of them out *twice*, under **inverted role names**. What one party calls its *encryption* key, the other calls its *decryption* key:

```
   two random keys           written out as four files, with the roles crossed
   ───────────────           ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

                        ┌──►  alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key     Alice ENCRYPTS with Key 1
      Key 1 ────────────┤
                        └──►  bob_keys/decryption_from_alice.key    Bob DECRYPTS with Key 1

                        ┌──►  bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key     Bob ENCRYPTS with Key 2
      Key 2 ────────────┤
                        └──►  alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key    Alice DECRYPTS with Key 2
```

So `alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key` and `bob_keys/decryption_from_alice.key` are **byte-identical** - they are the same Key 1 under two different names. Likewise `bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key` and `alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key` are both Key 2. That inversion is the entire mechanism: Alice encrypts with Key 1, and Bob can read it because his decryption key *is* Key 1.

The two directories are named after their **owner**; the files inside are named after the **peer** they are used with. Each party takes the whole directory bearing their own name:

| Party | Takes | Which is | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alice | `alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key` | Key 1 | encrypting messages she sends to Bob |
| Alice | `alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key` | Key 2 | decrypting messages she receives from Bob |
| Bob | `bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key` | Key 2 | encrypting messages he sends to Alice |
| Bob | `bob_keys/decryption_from_alice.key` | Key 1 | decrypting messages he receives from Alice |

Give Alice the `bob_keys/` directory by mistake and both parties will encrypt with the key the other is also encrypting with - every message will decrypt to garbage, and worse, the same key range will be consumed twice for two different messages, breaking the pad. Verify with `cmp` before distributing:

```bash
cmp alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key bob_keys/decryption_from_alice.key   # must be identical
cmp bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key   # must be identical
cmp alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key    # must DIFFER
```

See [Two keys per contact](#two-keys-per-contact-mirrored-between-the-two-parties) for why the roles are split this way.

`--add-contact` refuses two key files that overlap, since one pad serving both directions means the range that encrypts an outgoing message also decrypts an incoming one. The comparison is by content, not by name or size, so all these forms are rejected: the same file twice, a copy under a different name, a pad paired with part of itself (a partially consumed key from `.keychain/` is the *tail* of the pad it came from), and even a slice trimmed at both ends or two windows cut from the same pad - the check searches for each file's opening 64 bytes at *every* offset of the other with a rolling hash, so overlap is found wherever it hides, not only when the files line up at an end. Keys smaller than 64 bytes keep the aligned prefix/suffix comparison only, since a handful of bytes genuinely can coincide in two independent pads. The cost is one sequential read of each file, paid once per add.

The same search runs **across contacts**: a candidate key that overlaps a key already installed for any other contact is refused in the same-direction case (one pad consumed twice from its own start is two messages sharing bytes), and warned about in the mirrored case - new encryption key equals an existing decryption key or vice versa - which is how one machine legitimately operates both endpoints of its own pads for loopback testing in a single directory.

Removed contacts leave nothing to compare against, so `.keychain/spent_heads` keeps a durable fingerprint (two 64-bit digests, never key bytes) of each key's opening 64 bytes, recorded the first time they are consumed. A later `--add-contact` whose file still contains a recorded spent head - which the ORIGINAL distribution copy always does - is refused whatever the contact is now called, while the partially consumed remainder no longer contains it and stays acceptable. One trade-off is made knowingly: a digest of spent pad bytes lets someone who can read `.keychain/` *and* holds a captured ciphertext confirm a complete guess of that message's first 64 plaintext bytes. It recovers nothing on its own, and that reader already holds every live key in the directory; the alternative is the silent two-time pad the registry exists to prevent.

#### True Random key generator

Only a true random key makes this algorithm unbreakable.
To generate a true random key consider [Infinite Noise TRNG](https://www.crowdsupply.com/leetronics/infinite-noise-trng).


## Keychain Management Commands

List all keychain commands:
```bash
otp --help
```

Common operations:

- **Add contact without keys:** `otp --add-contact <name>` or `otp -ac <name>`
- **Add contact with keys:** `otp --add-contact <name> <enc_key> <dec_key>`
- **List contacts:** `otp --list-contacts` or `otp -lc`
- **Show contact details:** `otp --show-contact <name>` or `otp -sc <name>`
- **Remove contact:** `otp --remove-contact <name>` or `otp -rc <name>`
- **Check if contact exists:** `otp --has-contact <name>` or `otp -hc <name>`
- **Disk-verified status (for scripts/integrations):** `otp --status <name> [--porcelain]` or `otp -st <name>` - see [External Integrations](#external-integrations)
- **Re-emit the last payload's kept copy:** `otp --recover-last <name> --sent|--received` or `otp -rl <name> ...`
- **Add randomness to the vault:** `cat /dev/urandom | otp --add-rand-to-vault <size_in_MB>` - stores that much randomness at `.keychain/_randomness`, appended to if it already exists, created (mode 0600) if not; not assigned to any contact. On success prints `OK`, a blank line, then how much was just added and the vault's new running total:
  ```
  OK

  Added: 100 MB (104857600 bytes)
  Vault total: 340.00 MB (356515840 bytes)
  ```

#### Keychain Features

- **Streaming architecture:** Keys stored in `.keychain/` directory, read in 4MB chunks - supports keys up to 1TB without loading into RAM
- **Automatic key management:** Keys are consumed automatically; no manual key-file handling
- **Metadata tracking:** Sequence numbers, offsets, and timestamps tracked for each contact in its own `.keychain/<contact>.meta` file
- **Perfect forward secrecy:** Key consumption tracked via offsets; past messages can't be decrypted if offset information is lost
- **Binary safe:** Handles binary cipher text correctly
- **Security:** Keys are masked (displayed as *******) when viewing contact info
- **File structure:** everything lives inside `.keychain/`, one set of files per contact - see below

### The `.keychain/` directory

Everything `otp` stores lives in `.keychain/` in the current directory. There is no shared state between contacts: every file belongs to exactly one contact, and its name begins with that contact's name. This is what lets two contacts be operated on concurrently without any coordination between them.

```
.keychain/                        0700
├── alice.meta                    0600  metadata: key paths, offsets, sequences, timestamps
├── alice_enc.key                 0600  key material for encrypting messages to alice
├── alice_dec.key                 0600  key material for decrypting messages from alice
├── alice.lock                    0600  0-byte mutual-exclusion lock
├── bob.meta                      0600  a second contact - entirely separate files
├── bob_enc.key                   0600
├── bob_dec.key                   0600
└── bob.lock                      0600
```

`--add-contact` creates the `.meta` and the two `.key` files; the `.lock` file appears the first time that contact is used for an encrypt, decrypt or remove.

During an operation, and after an interrupted one, you may also see:

```
.keychain/
├── alice_enc_pending_seq7_off4096_len120.bin      published, verified output awaiting delivery
├── alice_enc_pending.31337.tmp                    output still being staged (pid-tagged)
├── alice_enc.key.tmp                              key file being rewritten minus the consumed prefix
└── alice.meta.tmp                                 metadata being rewritten
```

| File | Lifetime | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `<contact>.meta` | permanent | That contact's metadata. The only format this version reads or writes; written via verified-write-then-atomic-rename, so it is never observed half-updated. |
| `<contact>_enc.key`<br>`<contact>_dec.key` | permanent | The actual key material. Consumed from the front and physically truncated after each message, so the file's **size is the remaining key length** - this, not the metadata, is the authority. |
| `<contact>.lock` | permanent | Empty file backing the per-contact `flock()`, created on that contact's first encrypt/decrypt/remove. Deliberately never deleted, even when the contact is removed: unlinking it would let a waiter and a newcomer hold locks on different inodes at the same time. |
| `<contact>_<dir>_pending_seq<N>_off<O>_len<L>.bin` | transient | A finished, fsynced, read-back-verified message, tagged with the exact key range it used. Published *before* any key is declared spent, and deleted once delivered. If one survives a crash, its filename is what recovery reconciles against - see the recovery truth table below. |
| `<contact>_<dir>_pending.<pid>.tmp` | transient | Output still being staged. Never verified or published, so it carries no recoverable meaning; swept away by the next operation on that contact and direction. On the decrypt side it holds plaintext. |
| `<contact>_enc.key.tmp`<br>`<contact>_dec.key.tmp` | transient | The post-truncation key file, staged and verified before being renamed over the real one. |
| `<contact>.meta.tmp` | transient | The metadata file, staged and verified the same way. |
| `<contact>.last_sent`<br>`<contact>.last_received` | until next confirmed operation | An exact copy of what the last encrypt (ciphertext) or decrypt (plaintext) wrote to stdout, kept so a forgotten redirect cannot lose a message whose key bytes are already destroyed. `otp` removes it **automatically** - no manual cleanup is ever needed - the moment the next operation in that direction confirms delivery (interactive "yes" or `-y`); if delivery is instead rejected, `otp` offers to recover the copy to a file of your choosing. `--recover-last` streams it to stdout at any time without consuming it. Deleted with the contact. |
| `_randomness` | permanent | The randomness vault: a single sequential randomness stream, appended to by `--add-rand-to-vault`. Not tied to any contact - unlike everything else above, it is not itself consumed or tracked as key material, just accumulated storage. Guarded by its own `_randomness.lock` (the same per-name `flock()` a contact gets) and never touched until the incoming bytes are staged and read-back verified in full, so a short read from stdin or a concurrent invocation can't corrupt or interleave it. |
| `_randomness.lock` | permanent | Empty file backing the vault's `flock()`, exactly like `<contact>.lock`. |
| `_randomness_pending_<part_a>_<part_b>.bin` | transient | A vault-sourced `--new-key-pair`'s claimed randomness (`2 x <size_in_MB>` bytes), staged and read-back verified, then published here *before* the vault is truncated to remove it - the same commit-before-consume ordering a contact's key file gets. Deleted once every key file it fed has been written. If one survives a crash, rerunning `--new-key-pair` with the exact same size and party names finishes the truncation (if it hadn't completed yet) and regenerates the key files from it, instead of drawing fresh vault bytes on top. |

`<dir>` is `enc` or `dec`. Every transient file is either published by an atomic `rename()` or cleaned up; none of them is ever the only copy of anything that matters. Seeing one after a crash is normal - the next `otp -c <contact>` call reconciles it.

Everything here is created `0600` (the directory `0700`), key material included, from the moment it is written. Back up the whole directory together: a `.meta` file restored without its matching key file, or vice versa, is a mismatch `otp` will refuse to act on rather than risk reusing key material.

### Stages of one encrypt/decrypt operation

What follows is the actual order of operations in `encrypt_with_contact()` / `decrypt_with_contact()` (`src/cipher.c`), down to the individual `src/commit.c` primitives. The two directions are the same code path with `enc`/`dec` substituted; the only differences are noted at the end. The design rationale for the ordering is in "Crash-safe key consumption" below - this is the mechanical version.

**Phase 1 - Acquire (`encrypt_with_contact`)**

1. `find_contact()` - fail early if the name is unknown.
2. `get_keychain_dir()` - resolve `.keychain/`, creating it `0700` if absent.
3. `contact_lock_acquire()` - `open(<contact>.lock, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0600)` then `flock(fd, LOCK_EX)`. **Blocks here** until any other process working on this contact finishes.
4. `load_keychain()` - re-read every `<contact>.meta` from disk, *after* the lock is held. Whatever was read at startup may have been superseded by the process we just waited for.
5. `find_contact()` again - the reload invalidated the earlier pointer.

Everything below runs under the lock, in `encrypt_with_contact_locked()`.

**Phase 2 - Reconcile**

6. `commit_reconcile()` - one `opendir(.keychain)` pass that unlinks any `<contact>_<dir>_pending.<pid>.tmp` (abandoned staging: unverified, no recoverable meaning) and locates a published `<contact>_<dir>_pending_seq<N>_off<O>_len<L>.bin`. Only if such an artifact exists does it then `otp_file_size()` the key file and weigh that, the `.meta` values, and the artifact's own filename tag against the three-window truth table. With no artifact - the normal case - it returns immediately.
7. On `FINISH`: apply the corrected offset/size/sequence and `save_contact_meta()`. On `FINISH` or `DELIVER`: `deliver_pending_file()`, `commit_discard_path()`, **return `KEYCHAIN_REDELIVERED` (exit 8)** - this run's input is deliberately not read.
8. `resync_key_size()` - `otp_file_size()` the key file against the `.meta` size. Smaller means the metadata is behind: adopt the file's size, report it, `save_contact_meta()`. Larger means key material was rolled back - **abort**, its leading bytes are already spent.

**Phase 3 - Produce (nothing is committed yet)**

9. `fopen(<contact>_<dir>.key, "rb")` - always from byte 0. The file *is* the unconsumed key; there is no seek-to-offset. The first 16 bytes read are the message's source_id chunk - embedded (encrypted) in the metadata, never used as pad (see [Origin and order verification](#origin-and-order-verification)). On encrypt, the metadata block (source_id, sequence, offset) is built here. On decrypt, it is instead read from the front of the input, decrypted with the pad bytes that follow the chunk, and validated against the expected source_id/sequence/offset - **any mismatch rejects the message right here**, with its distinct exit code, before anything is staged or a single key byte is spent.
10. `malloc` two 4MB buffers, then `commit_stage_open()` - `unlink` + `open(<contact>_<dir>_pending.<pid>.tmp, O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600)`, CRC32 state initialised. On encrypt, the encrypted metadata block is the staging file's first write.
11. Loop until `fread(input)` returns 0:
    - **bounds check** `input_bytes > available_key - reserved - total` (`reserved` = the 16-byte source_id chunk plus the metadata pad, both part of this message's key range) → abort before any XOR. This is what stops a multi-chunk message from emitting chunks it cannot finish;
    - `fread` the same number of key bytes; a short read aborts;
    - XOR in place;
    - `commit_stage_write()` - append to the staging file and fold into the CRC32. **This is the only sink**; nothing reaches `output` in this loop;
12. `fclose` the key file, free the buffers, reject an empty message.
13. `commit_stage_close_verified()` - `fflush` → `fsync` → `fclose` → **reopen and re-read the file**, recomputing the CRC32 and comparing length and checksum. A successful `fwrite` only proves libc accepted the bytes; this proves they are on disk.

**Phase 4 - Commit (ordering is load-bearing)**

14. `commit_pending_path()` - compose the name tagging the exact range: sequence `EncryptedSequence + 1`, offset `EncryptionKeyOffset`, length = the message's full consumed range (source_id chunk + metadata pad + payload pad).
15. `commit_publish()` - `otp_rename_replace()` the staging file to that name, then `fsync` the containing directory so the rename survives power loss and not just a kill (POSIX; a no-op on Windows, which has no directory handle to sync). The message now exists durably, tagged, but **no key is declared spent**. `[crash point: after_pending_publish]`
16. `truncate_key_file()` - `otp_fseek()` past the consumed prefix, stream the remainder in 4MB chunks through a fresh `CommitStage` into `<contact>_<dir>.key.tmp`, `commit_stage_close_verified()` it, then `commit_publish()` it over the real key file. The consumed bytes are now physically gone. `[crash point: after_key_publish]`
17. Update the in-memory contact: sequence, offset advanced by the full consumed range, size `= remaining`, timestamp.
18. `save_contact_meta()` - build the whole file in memory, `commit_write_verified()` it to `<contact>.meta.tmp` (write → `fsync` → reopen → **byte-for-byte `memcmp`**), then `commit_publish()`. `[crash point: after_keychain_save]`

Steps 15, 16 and 18 are the only three durable state changes, and they happen in that order. Reversing 16 and 18 would let a crash leave the metadata calling a range spent while the key file still physically held those exact reusable bytes.

**Phase 5 - Deliver**

19. `deliver_pending_file()` - stream the published artifact to `output` in 64KB reads. By now both commits are durable, so this step is freely retryable and cannot affect key state.
20. `commit_discard_path()` - unlink the artifact.
21. Report bytes used and key remaining on `stderr`; `contact_lock_release()` on the way out.

**Where a crash lands.** Before step 15, nothing exists and nothing was spent. Between 15 and 16, the artifact exists but no key was consumed - discarded. Between 16 and 18, key consumed but metadata stale - finished from the artifact's filename, then redelivered. After 18, everything committed - redelivered. Recovery is step 6 of the next run; the truth table is below.

The same four outcomes cover an I/O failure as well as a crash: a `.meta` write that fails after the key file is already committed leaves exactly the between-16-and-18 state, and recovers identically.

**Decrypt differs in three ways:** the metadata block at the front of the input is validated in step 9 and stripped, so the artifact holds only the recovered plaintext payload rather than ciphertext - which is why staging it before spending key matters more, not less, since a lost plaintext cannot be recomputed once its key bytes are gone; the spent-heads fingerprint is recorded only after that validation passes, so a rejected message leaves no trace anywhere; and `LastMessageReceivedAt` is stamped instead of `LastMessageSentAt`.

## One Time Pad algorithm requirements

The one-time pad is the only encryption scheme with a proof of perfect secrecy, but that proof rests entirely on two conditions. Break either one and the guarantee is not weakened, it is gone:

1. **The key must be fully random.** Every key byte must be independent and uniformly distributed. A key from a PRNG is only as strong as that PRNG's seed, which reduces the pad to a stream cipher. Use a hardware entropy source - see [True Random key generator](#true-random-key-generator) above.
2. **A piece of key may be used exactly once - ever.** Not once per direction, not once per machine, not "probably once". If two messages are ever encrypted with the same key range, XORing the two ciphertexts cancels the key entirely and yields the XOR of the two plaintexts, from which both are routinely recoverable.

Requirement 1 is a property of how the key is generated, and is outside this tool's control beyond `--new-key-pair`. Requirement 2 is a property of how the key is *consumed*, and is what everything below exists to enforce.

Requirement 2 also has a transport-side corollary: within one direction messages must be decrypted in the exact order they were sent, complete, exactly once. Two mechanisms enforce it from opposite ends. On the receiving end, every message carries an encrypted metadata block (see [Origin and order verification](#origin-and-order-verification)) that the decrypt validates against its own key state *before* any key is spent - a message that is lost, reordered, duplicated, truncated or from the wrong source is rejected with a distinct exit code and the keys untouched, instead of silently XORing against the wrong key range. What the tool still cannot know is whether the *previous* delivered message actually reached and decoded for its reader - only the correspondents can confirm delivery, out of band - so `otp` makes that an enforced checkpoint: before spending key on any message after a direction's first, it asks on the terminal (never on `stdin`, which carries the message itself) whether the previous message in that direction - identified by its sequence number, date, and key offset - arrived and decoded correctly, and cancels with the keys untouched unless answered yes. Once you have confirmed out of band, pass `-y`/`--assume-delivered` (or set `OTP_ASSUME_DELIVERED=1`) to skip the prompt; scripts must do so explicitly, because with no terminal to ask on the operation fails closed rather than assuming delivery. Crash-recovery redelivery is never gated - it re-emits already-committed output and consumes no new key.

## Origin and order verification

Before a single key byte is spent, every decrypt verifies that the incoming message really was produced with the mirror of this contact's key - at exactly the expected position - and that it is exactly the next message expected in this direction. A replayed, reordered, foreign, truncated or corrupted message is rejected with the keys untouched and a distinct exit code naming what failed.

This is achieved through a per-message metadata layer: a small binary metadata block, itself encrypted, prepended to the plaintext before the XOR pass. Tags, length fields and values are all raw binary, so the overhead is typically 23 bytes of ciphertext plus the 16-byte source_id chunk:

```
0x01 <source_id: 16 bytes>             a chunk of the key itself
0x02 <len: varint> <seq: len bytes>    message sequence number, big-endian
0x03 <len: varint> <off: len bytes>    absolute key offset, big-endian
<plaintext...>
```

The length field is a ULEB128 varint (7 value bits per byte, high bit set on every byte except the last), so `seq` and `off` may be of **any byte-length**: a value up to 127 bytes wide needs a single length byte, wider values grow the length field itself. Values are written with the minimal number of bytes, so this build (whose counters are 64-bit) emits 1-8 value bytes behind a one-byte length - but the parser accepts any width, streaming arbitrarily wide values in constant memory. A well-formed value too wide to ever equal this build's expected seq/offset fails that field's validation with its own exit code below; it is not treated as a malformed message.

The key range one message consumes is one contiguous run starting at the sender's current offset `off`:

```
[off,       off + 16)       the source_id chunk - embedded (encrypted) in the
                            metadata, never used as pad
[off + 16,  off + 16 + N)   the XOR pad for the N = metadata + plaintext bytes
```

Both sides therefore consume exactly `N + 16` key bytes per message, and the source_id doubles as proof of origin: it is the very key material the receiver's mirrored decryption key holds at that same position, and it is destroyed on both sides with the rest of the message's range.

### Validation on decrypt

Before any key is spent - before anything is staged, delivered or truncated - the decrypt validates the metadata against its own key state:

1. **source_id** must equal the decryption key's own next 16 bytes (the chunk at the expected offset), proving the message was produced with the mirror of this exact key at this exact position.
2. **seq** must be exactly the next sequence number this contact expects.
3. **offset** must be exactly this contact's current key offset.

A message that fails any check is rejected: the failure reasons are printed to `stderr` (with `FAIL`, in red on a terminal), **no key material is consumed**, nothing is written to `stdout`, and the process exits with the code naming the exact combination that failed:

| Exit code | Invalid fields |
|-----------|----------------|
| `1` | source_id |
| `2` | seq |
| `3` | offset |
| `4` | source_id and seq |
| `7` | source_id and offset |
| `6` | seq and offset |
| `5` | source_id, seq and offset |

A message whose metadata cannot even be parsed verifies nothing and is rejected with exit `5`: garbage, a truncated fragment, ciphertext from an incompatible or pre-metadata sender, an empty message, and input that fails with a read error before the metadata is complete all land here - fewer bytes than a metadata block means there is nothing to verify, so nothing is ever decrypted blindly. Note that exit `1` is shared with generic errors, and a crash-recovery redelivery exits `8`.

On success the metadata is stripped: the delivered plaintext is byte-for-byte the original message.


## Accidental mid-crash protection

The one-time pad requires that the key portion used to encrypt a plaintext is never reused. Although this seems straightforward to implement, there are accidents along the way - a `kill -9`, a power cut, a full disk, a broken pipe, two invocations racing - and almost all of them land in the gap between *"the message has been produced"* and *"the key has been recorded as spent"*. Anything that leaves that gap open reopens requirement 2.

Below is each stage of an operation, the accident that can occur at that exact point, and the mechanism that resolves it. Stage numbers refer to the walkthrough above.

### One Time Pad encryption

| Stage | Accident | How it's solved |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Acquire lock (3) | Two processes encrypt for the same contact at once. Each reads the same starting offset and each produces individually valid output - using the same key bytes twice. | Exclusive per-contact `flock()` on `<contact>.lock`. The second process blocks until the first has fully committed. Verification alone cannot catch this: neither process is wrong in isolation. |
| 1. Reload (4) | The process read its metadata at startup, then waited on the lock. It now holds a snapshot from *before* the operation it just waited for, and would compute key ranges that are already spent. | `load_keychain()` is re-run *after* the lock is acquired, so the operation always starts from authoritative on-disk state. |
| 2. Reconcile (6-7) | A previous run died mid-commit. Its key range may or may not already be spent, and guessing wrong either wastes key or reuses it. | The artifact's filename records the exact range it used. Comparing the physical key file size, the `.meta` values and that tag identifies which of three windows the crash landed in - deterministically, never heuristically. |
| 2. Resync (8) | A restored backup or hand-edited `.meta` disagrees with the key file. If it overstates the remaining key, every later operation fails permanently; if the *key file* was rolled back, its leading bytes are already spent and reusing them breaks the pad. | The key file is authoritative (bytes are consumed from the front and it is truncated). Smaller than the metadata claims: adopt the file's size and continue. Larger: refuse outright and tell the user to re-key. |
| 3. Produce (11) | The message turns out to be longer than the remaining key partway through. A streaming implementation that writes as it goes has already emitted the first chunks - key material is now exposed in delivered ciphertext while its range still looks unused. | The length check runs *before* each chunk is XORed, and every chunk is written to a staging file rather than to `output`. Nothing reaches the caller until the whole message is complete and verified. |
| 3. Verify (13) | `fwrite()` succeeded, but the bytes never reached the platter, or reached it corrupted. Key would be spent on a message that cannot actually be delivered. | `commit_stage_close_verified()` fsyncs, then reopens the file and recomputes a CRC32 over what is *actually on disk*, comparing both length and checksum. |
| 4. Publish artifact (15) | Crash immediately after the ciphertext is published. | Nothing was spent and nothing was delivered, so the artifact is stale evidence. Recovery discards it; no key is lost and the next run proceeds normally. |
| 4. Truncate key (16) | Crash between consuming the key and recording it - or during the truncation itself, leaving a half-rewritten key file. | The key file is only ever replaced by an atomic rename of a separately staged, verified copy, so it is never observed half-written. A crash here leaves it correctly shrunk with stale metadata, which recovery completes from the artifact's filename tag. |
| 4. Ordering (16 before 18) | If metadata were committed first, a crash between the two would leave it declaring a range spent while the key file still physically held those exact bytes - unread, and reusable by the next run. | Key file first, always. The reverse crash is then merely a stale record, never a live reuse hole. |
| 4. Save metadata (18) | Crash during the metadata write leaves a truncated `.meta` and an unreadable contact. | Built entirely in memory, written to `.meta.tmp`, fsynced, reopened and compared byte-for-byte, then atomically renamed. The live `.meta` only ever transitions between two complete versions. |
| 5. Deliver (19) | Broken pipe, full disk, or a crash while streaming to `stdout` - after the key has already been consumed. Naively, the message is gone and the key with it. | Both commits are already durable and the verified artifact is still on disk. The next run detects a fully-committed state and redelivers it byte-identically. Delivery is retryable precisely because it happens last. |
| 5. Redelivery | The redelivering run was also given fresh input on `stdin`. Processing both would blur which message was actually sent. | A recovering run redelivers *only*, never also encrypting new input, and exits `8` instead of `0` so a script cannot mistake it for having sent its own message. |

### One Time Pad decryption

Decryption runs the identical protocol, but the stakes at one specific point are different: the staged artifact is **plaintext**, and unlike ciphertext it cannot be recomputed once the corresponding key bytes are gone from both sides.

| Stage | Accident | How it's solved |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Acquire lock (3) | Two processes decrypt for the same contact at once, both consuming the same decryption key range. | The same exclusive per-contact `flock()`; encrypt, decrypt and remove all take it. |
| 2. Reconcile / resync (6-8) | An interrupted decrypt left the decryption key and `.meta` out of step, or a restored backup rolled the decryption key back. | The same truth table and the same authoritative-key-file rule, applied to the `dec` direction independently of `enc`. |
| 3. Produce (11) | Ciphertext arrives longer than the remaining decryption key, discovered partway through. | The same pre-XOR bounds check, and the same "staging file is the only sink" rule. |
| 3. Verify (13) | The recovered plaintext is written but not durably or correctly on disk when the key is about to be destroyed. | Same fsync-and-read-back verification - and here it is the difference between a recoverable message and a permanently lost one. |
| 4. Commit (15-18) | **The defining case:** a crash after the decryption key bytes are consumed but before the plaintext is safe on disk. The ciphertext alone is now undecryptable forever, because the key that produced it no longer exists on either side. | The plaintext is staged, fsynced, verified and published *before* any key is declared spent. The worst a crash can do is require a redelivery, never a loss. |
| Aborted staging | A process killed mid-decrypt leaves a partial staging file that contains real recovered plaintext sitting in `.keychain/`. | Abandoned `<contact>_dec_pending.<pid>.tmp` files are swept by the next operation on that contact and direction, and removing a contact deletes every trace of its staged content. |
| 5. Deliver (19) | Crash or broken pipe while writing plaintext to `stdout`, after the key is gone. | The verified plaintext is still on disk; the next run redelivers it exactly, and exits `8` so the caller knows its own input was not processed. |

### What this does not cover

Everything above protects requirement 2 against **accidents inside one keychain**: no crash, kill, power loss, disk error or concurrent invocation can make the same key range cover two messages. That guarantee rests on one precondition the program cannot enforce - that the keychain directory is never rolled back or duplicated. The authority for "what is still unspent" is the key file's own length, which is self-evidently correct as long as it only ever moves forwards. Nothing outside it records that a byte was spent, so anything that turns the clock back is invisible:

- **Restoring `.keychain/` from a backup is total, silent key reuse.** Snapshot the directory, send a message, restore the snapshot, send another - both messages are encrypted with the same key range, and XORing the two ciphertexts recovers the XOR of the two plaintexts. Exit status 0, no warning. The rolled-back-key refusal does *not* catch this, because the key file and its metadata were rolled back together and therefore agree with each other; that check only detects an *inconsistent* rollback. **Do not snapshot, sync, or restore `.keychain/` while it is in use.** If you must back it up, treat restoring it as re-keying: the contacts in the restored copy have to be given fresh key material before anything is sent.
- **The same key files on two machines** is the same failure by another route - both consume from offset 0 with no way to learn about each other.
- **Re-adding a contact from the original distribution key** restarts at offset 0 over already-spent bytes. On the *same* keychain this is now refused, not just warned about: the spent-heads registry recognizes the original's opening bytes even after the contact and its key files are gone (see [The roles are inverted between the two parties](#the-roles-are-inverted-between-the-two-parties) above). The registry lives inside `.keychain/`, though, so it shares the directory's rollback blind spot, and it cannot see spending that happened on a *different* machine - only supply key material that has never been used anywhere.
- **The pad is not authenticated.** It provides secrecy, not integrity: a flipped ciphertext bit flips the same plaintext bit undetectably. Nothing here changes that.
- **An attacker with write access to `.keychain/`** can do all of the above deliberately.

Key distribution and requirement 1 remain yours.

## Files written to disk

Everything `otp` creates itself is mode `0600` (and the `.keychain/` directory `0700`) from the moment of creation - key material is never briefly world-readable and is never chmod'd after the fact.

| Mode | Files created | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Keychain (`-c`, `-ac`, `-rc`) | `<contact>.meta`, `<contact>_enc.key`, `<contact>_dec.key`, `<contact>.lock`, `<contact>.last_sent`/`<contact>.last_received` (safety copy of the last delivered payload, removed automatically by `otp` once the next operation confirms delivery), plus the transient staging and pending files - see [The `.keychain/` directory](#the-keychain-directory) for the full table | `.keychain/` in the current directory |
| Key-pair generation (`-nk`) | `<a>_keys/encryption_for_<b>.key`, `<a>_keys/decryption_from_<b>.key`, `<b>_keys/encryption_for_<a>.key`, `<b>_keys/decryption_from_<a>.key` (the `<name>_keys/` directories are created `0700`) | current directory |

**The keychain location is not configurable.** It is always `.keychain/` relative to the process's current working directory, so running `otp` from a different directory uses a different keychain. That is what lets you keep two correspondents' keychains side by side in separate directories.

**Redirected output is not covered by any of this.** Ciphertext and plaintext go to `stdout`; when you redirect it, the file is created by your *shell*, with your umask - typically `0644`:

```bash
otp -c bob --encrypt < secret.txt > cipher.bin   # cipher.bin is 0644, created by the shell
```

Ciphertext being world-readable is harmless, but the same applies to plaintext on the decrypt side. If that matters, set `umask 077` first or write into a directory that is already `0700`.

## How to use (encryption / decryption)

### Using the Keychain System

The keychain system provides a convenient way to manage multiple contacts and their encryption/decryption keys. Each contact's metadata and key files all live under the `.keychain/` directory. Keys are automatically consumed via offset tracking as you encrypt/decrypt messages, supporting extremely large keys (up to 1TB) through streaming.

#### Two keys per contact, mirrored between the two parties

Every contact in your keychain holds a **key pair**, never a single key:

- `<contact>_enc.key` - consumed only when you **send** to that contact
- `<contact>_dec.key` - consumed only when you **receive** from that contact

The pair is **shared with the other party with the two roles inverted** - the inversion applied at generation time (see [The roles are inverted between the two parties](#the-roles-are-inverted-between-the-two-parties)) carries straight through into the keychain. Your encryption key is byte-identical to their decryption key, and their encryption key is byte-identical to yours. Neither key is ever used for both roles by the same party. The two keychains line up like this:

```
        Alice's .keychain/                              Bob's .keychain/

  bob_enc.key  ─── same bytes (Key 1) ────────────►  alice_dec.key
  (Alice sends)             the roles invert         (Bob receives)

  bob_dec.key  ◄──────────── same bytes (Key 2) ───  alice_enc.key
  (Alice receives)          the roles invert         (Bob sends)
```

Read a row across and the inversion is the whole point: the file Alice consumes to **encrypt** is the same file Bob consumes to **decrypt**.

**Why a pair rather than one shared key: parallel, non-blocking messaging in both directions.** With a single shared key, the two parties would be drawing from the same range, so every message would have to be coordinated - turn-taking, acknowledgements, or some agreed split - and any two messages sent at the same time would collide on the same key bytes and break the pad.

Two independent keys remove that problem by construction. The outgoing and incoming directions consume entirely different files, tracked by entirely separate offsets and sequence numbers (`EncryptionKeyOffset`/`EncryptedSequence` versus `DecryptionKeyOffset`/`DecryptedSequence` in `<contact>.meta`). So:

- Alice can send while Bob is sending. Messages may cross in flight; neither consumes key material the other is using.
- Neither machine ever waits for or is even aware of the other's activity. There is **no protocol-level coordination between the two machines at all** - not even a shared counter.
- The independence is between the two *directions*, not within one: each direction's messages must still be decrypted in the exact order they were sent, complete, exactly once. [Origin and order verification](#origin-and-order-verification) rejects violations at decrypt time before any key is spent, and the delivery-confirmation prompt (see [One Time Pad algorithm requirements](#one-time-pad-algorithm-requirements)) makes each operator additionally vouch for the previous message before more key is spent.

The only serialization is local and brief: on one machine, concurrent operations on the *same* contact take that contact's `.lock` (see [Per-contact locking](#per-contact-locking)), so two processes cannot draw from the same key file at once. Operations on *different* contacts share nothing and run fully in parallel.

Because the two directions are independent, they also exhaust independently - a chatty sender can run out of encryption key while its decryption key is still nearly full. `--show-contact` reports both remaining sizes separately.

#### Setup Keychain

1. **Generate a key pair** (on a secure machine):
   ```bash
   cat /dev/urandom | otp --new-key-pair 1 alice bob
   ```

2. **Distribute keys securely** (via encrypted USB, in-person, etc.):
   - Alice receives the `alice_keys/` directory (`encryption_for_bob.key` and `decryption_from_bob.key`)
   - Bob receives the `bob_keys/` directory (`encryption_for_alice.key` and `decryption_from_alice.key`)

3. **Add contacts to keychain**:
   
   On Alice's machine:
   ```bash
   otp --add-contact bob alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key
   ```
   
   On Bob's machine:
   ```bash
   otp --add-contact alice bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key bob_keys/decryption_from_alice.key
   ```

#### Encrypt and Decrypt with Keychain

**Alice sends encrypted message to Bob:**
```bash
echo "Hello Bob!" | otp -c bob --encrypt > message.bin
```

**Bob decrypts Alice's message:**
```bash
cat message.bin | otp -c alice --decrypt
# Output: Hello Bob!
```

**Bob sends encrypted reply to Alice:**
```bash
echo "Hi Alice!" | otp -c alice --encrypt > reply.bin
```

**Alice decrypts Bob's reply:**
```bash
cat reply.bin | otp -c bob --decrypt
# Output: Hi Alice!
```

#### Example Workflow

Complete example of secure communication:

```bash
# 1. Generate 1MB key pair
cat /dev/urandom | otp --new-key-pair 1 alice bob

# 2. Alice adds Bob to her keychain (using her own alice_keys/ pair)
otp --add-contact bob alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key

# 3. Bob adds Alice to his keychain (on his machine, using his bob_keys/ pair)
otp --add-contact alice bob_keys/encryption_for_alice.key bob_keys/decryption_from_alice.key

# 4. Alice encrypts and sends
echo "Secret message" | otp -c bob --encrypt > msg1.bin
# Transfer msg1.bin to Bob via any channel (it's encrypted)

# 5. Bob decrypts (on his machine)
cat msg1.bin | otp -c alice --decrypt
# Output: Secret message

# 6. Check contact status
otp --show-contact bob
# Shows: key sizes, offsets, sequence number, timestamps, etc.
```

#### Important Notes

- **Key consumption:** Key consumption is tracked via offsets and enforced by physically truncating the key files
- **Keychain location:** the `.keychain/` directory is in the current directory; everything (keys, metadata, locks) lives inside it
- **File permissions:** everything `otp` creates inside `.keychain/` is created `0600` (and the directory `0700`) - key files included, from the moment they are copied in. No manual `chmod` is needed
- **Backup:** Back up the `.keychain/` directory securely if needed
- **Contact names:** a contact's name is used verbatim as a filename, so names may not be `.` or `..`, contain a path separator (`/` or `\`), any of `: * ? " < > | =`, or control characters. Anything else - spaces, dots, non-ASCII - is fine
- **Key exhaustion:** Monitor key sizes with `--show-contact` to know when to generate new keys
- **Large keys:** Supports keys up to 1TB through streaming architecture - no RAM limitations. Every step that touches a key file streams it in fixed-size chunks, including the truncation that follows each message, so peak memory does not scale with key size. The 1TB range applies to 64-bit builds; a 32-bit build can only address key files up to 4GiB minus one byte, and refuses a larger one with an explicit "too large for this build" error before any key is spent (never by mis-measuring it - large-file support is compiled in, so even a 32-bit build stats big files correctly). The limit is per build, not per keychain: the same keychain files work on a 64-bit build up to the full 1TB
- **Exit codes for `-c`:** `0` success, `8` a recovered message from an interrupted earlier run was redelivered and **this run's input was not processed** (re-run to send it), `1`-`7` on `--decrypt` a metadata validation failure (see [Origin and order verification](#origin-and-order-verification); no key material is consumed), any other non-zero value an error

## Crash-safe key consumption

A one-time pad is only unbreakable if every key byte is used **exactly once** - ever. That guarantee has to hold even if `otp` is killed, the machine loses power, or the disk fills up in the middle of an operation. This is what the keychain encrypt/decrypt path (`src/commit.c`) is designed around, and it's worth understanding if you're relying on this tool for real secrecy.

### Why a naive implementation isn't enough

The obvious approach - encrypt, write the ciphertext to `stdout`, then update the key file and the contact's metadata - has a gap: if the process dies after the ciphertext has left the machine but before the key state is updated, the key range it used still looks "available." The next run reuses it. XORing the two resulting ciphertexts together cancels the key and recovers the XOR of both plaintexts - a catastrophic break of the pad, triggered by nothing more than an unlucky `Ctrl-C` or `kill -9`.

### The fix: commit before delivery, verify everything, never guess on recovery

Every encrypt/decrypt operation goes through three stages, always in this order:

1. **Stage.** The finished ciphertext (or plaintext) is written to a working file, `fsync`'d, and read back to confirm every byte on disk matches what was intended - a successful `fwrite()` only proves libc accepted the bytes, not that they're durably and correctly on disk. It's then published under a permanent name tagged with the exact key range it corresponds to: `<contact>_enc_pending_seq<N>_off<O>_len<L>.bin` inside `.keychain/`. At this point nothing has been declared "spent" - this is just durable evidence.
2. **Commit.** The key file is truncated to remove the consumed prefix (written to a temp file, verified by read-back, then published via an atomic `rename()`), and *only then* is the contact's own `.keychain/<contact>.meta` file rewritten the same way - built in memory, verified, atomically renamed into place. **This order is not arbitrary.** If the metadata file were committed first, a crash between the two would leave it believing a key range is spent while the key file still physically contains those exact, unread, reusable bytes - reopening the reuse hole. Committing the key file first means a crash between the two instead leaves the key file already correctly reduced and the metadata merely lagging behind - a state that's always safely recoverable, never a reuse risk.
3. **Deliver.** Only once both commits are durable does the staged file get streamed to the real output. Because the ciphertext already exists, verified, on local disk, delivery is now a plain, freely-retryable step - a failure here can't lose or duplicate anything, it just needs to happen again.

### Recovering from a crash

Every encrypt/decrypt call first checks for a leftover pending artifact from an interrupted previous run, before doing anything else. Whichever of the three stages a crash landed in leaves a distinct, unambiguous fingerprint, found by comparing the *physical* size of the key file on disk against what the contact's `.meta` file currently declares and against the range recorded in the pending artifact's own filename:

| Situation on disk | What it means | Recovery action |
|---|---|---|
| Key file size unchanged, `.meta` offset unchanged | Crash before either commit - nothing was ever spent or delivered | Discard the pending file. No key material lost. |
| Key file already shrunk by the length recorded in the pending file's name, `.meta` still stale | Crash between the two commits | Finish the `.meta` update using the range recorded in the pending file's own name - not a guess, the exact numbers it was tagged with - then redeliver. |
| Key file and `.meta` both already reflect the range | Fully committed, only delivery/cleanup was missed | Redeliver the pending file as-is. |
| None of the above | The artifact's recorded range cannot be reconciled with the key file and the metadata | Discard it without redelivering, and say so. Guessing which range was really spent is the one thing recovery must never do; the run then proceeds normally from the state that *is* known. |
| The key file cannot be read at all | Nothing can be concluded either way - and the failure may be transient (a mount hiccup, fd exhaustion) | Keep the artifact and abort the run, and say so. On the decrypt side the artifact is the *only* copy of the recovered plaintext - its key bytes are already gone - so discarding it over an unreadable key file would turn a transient failure into permanent message loss. A later run reconciles it normally once the key file is readable again; the run must abort rather than proceed, since staging new output next to the kept artifact would create the "more than one artifact" state below. |
| More than one artifact for the same contact and direction | Only one can exist under normal operation, since reconciliation runs before anything new is staged | Discard the extras rather than pick one arbitrarily, for the same reason. |

Recovery is automatic - the next `otp -c <contact> --encrypt`/`--decrypt` call handles it without any extra flag - but it's never silent. It prints exactly what happened to `stderr`, e.g.:

```
Recovered incomplete delivery for contact 'bob' (message #5, key range 40960-41060):
redelivering the previously computed ciphertext now instead of processing new input.
Run the command again to encrypt new input.
```

When recovery redelivers a pending message, that invocation does **only** that - it never also processes new input from the same run, so there's no ambiguity about what was actually sent. Run the command again afterward for anything new.

Because that run produced valid output while leaving its input entirely unprocessed, it exits **`8`**, not `0`. A script that treated it as success would believe its message had been encrypted when the bytes it received actually belong to a different one; the distinct code lets it detect and retry without parsing `stderr`.

### Why decrypt needs this even more than encrypt

For encryption, the staged artifact is ciphertext - not secret, safe to leave on disk, safe to redeliver any number of times. For decryption, the staged artifact is plaintext, so committing key consumption before it's safely staged would be worse than merely risky: if a crash destroyed the only copy of that plaintext after its key bytes were already gone, the message would be **permanently unrecoverable** - unlike a lost encryption, there's no "just re-encrypt it" option once the corresponding key material no longer exists on either side. Staging the plaintext durably first, under the same `0600` permissions as the key material itself, is what turns that into "redeliver it on the next run" instead of "gone forever."

### Per-contact locking

Crash-safety alone isn't enough if two processes run concurrently against the *same* contact - each would independently read the same starting key offset and each produce individually correct-looking, individually verified output. Staging and read-back verification has no way to detect that, because nothing about either process's own work is wrong in isolation; the problem only exists between them. That requires actual mutual exclusion, not more verification.

Every `encrypt`/`decrypt`/`remove-contact` call for a given contact takes an exclusive lock on `<contact>.lock`, created in the same `.keychain/` directory as that contact's key files and pending artifacts, before touching anything. It's a plain `flock()`, which the kernel releases automatically the moment the holding process's file descriptor closes - including on a crash or `kill -9` - so there is no separate stale-lock state to detect or clean up; it composes directly with the crash-recovery mechanism above rather than needing its own.

A process that has to wait for the lock also **reloads the contact's metadata from disk immediately after acquiring it**, rather than trusting whatever it read when it started. Without this, a process that waited out someone else's operation would still be holding a snapshot from before that operation committed, and would go on to compute key ranges against data that's no longer current - a subtler version of the same problem locking is meant to solve. Two concurrent encryptions for the same contact are therefore fully serialized: whichever acquires the lock first consumes the next key range, and the second sees that consumption reflected before it reads anything.

### Per-contact metadata files

Locking makes two processes on the *same* contact safe, but it does nothing for two processes on two *different* contacts - they never contend for the same lock. What protects them is that they have nothing in common to contend over.

Each contact's metadata lives in its own `.keychain/<contact>.meta`, written and committed exactly like the key file: `commit_write_verified` then `commit_publish`. Two different contacts write to two entirely different files, so there is no shared mutable state between them at all. This isn't locking working around a shared resource; it's the shared resource not existing.

`load_keychain()` is a **pure reader** - it writes nothing. That is what makes it safe to call both before any lock is held (at startup) and again after a contact's lock is acquired. If loading wrote, two processes starting at the same time could each persist their own stale view of a contact, one overwriting offsets the other had just committed.

A contact exists if and only if it has a `<contact>.meta` file. Nothing else in the keychain directory is consulted to decide that.

### Self-healing metadata

The key file, not the metadata, is the authority on how much key material remains: bytes are consumed from the front and the file is physically truncated, so its size *is* the remaining length. Metadata can still drift from it - a restored backup, a hand-edit - and without it, every later operation failed with `Failed to read remaining key` and kept failing, because nothing ever re-derived the truth from the file.

Each operation now compares the two before spending any key, and resolves the disagreement in the only direction that is safe:

- **Key file smaller than the metadata claims** - the metadata is simply behind. Adopt the file's size, report the correction on `stderr`, persist it, and carry on.
- **Key file larger than the metadata claims** - this cannot happen through any code path here, because key files only ever shrink. It means key material was restored or rolled back to an older copy, and the extra bytes at the front of the file have already been used once. Continuing would reuse them, so this is **refused** with an explanation rather than "healed."

### Known limitations

- **Delivery is not byte-resumable:** if a crash interrupts the final delivery step partway through writing to `stdout`, recovery redelivers the message from the beginning. Key state stays exactly correct, but a consumer that already received part of the stream will see those bytes twice. The recovery notice on `stderr` and the distinct exit code (`8`) make this detectable rather than silent.
- **Deleted staged files are unlinked, not shredded:** pending artifacts and abandoned staging files are removed with `unlink()`. On a journaling or copy-on-write filesystem, or on flash, their contents may remain recoverable from the underlying media afterwards.

## External Integrations

A program that wants to send and receive one-time-pad messages does not need `otp` as a library - the command itself is the API. Encrypt/decrypt are pure stdin→stdout filters with distinct exit codes (`0` processed, `8` redelivered, `1` error, and per-combination metadata validation codes on `--decrypt` - see [Origin and order verification](#origin-and-order-verification)), the delivery-confirmation gate is scriptable with `-y`, and two read-only query commands - `--status` and `--recover-last` - expose everything else a driving program must know. The process boundary is not a compromise, it is part of the design: each operation's plaintext and key bytes live in an address space that is gone when the call returns, and the crash-safety model (built around "a run was interrupted") keeps its one-process-per-operation shape.

### The four questions an integrated program must answer

Before its next operation on a contact, an integrated client needs to know, per direction:

1. **Did my last encrypt/decrypt complete?** At operation time the exit code answers this (`0` = staged, CRC-verified on disk, key committed, delivered). After a restart, the same answer is reconstructed from disk by `--status`.
2. **Will the next operation process my input at all?** If an interrupted run left a *committed* message behind, the next operation redelivers that message (exit `8`) and does **not** read its input. `--status` reports this in advance as `redelivery_pending`.
3. **Was the last sent message delivered?** `otp` cannot know this - only the correspondents can, out of band. What `otp` tracks is whether it has been *told*: the `.last_sent` copy exists until the next confirmed operation. `--status` reports that as `ack_outstanding`; the client answers it by passing `-y` once the peer acknowledged.
4. **Was the last received message handed over intact?** Symmetric, via `.last_received` on the decrypt side.

All four answers live in the `.keychain/` files already; the two commands below expose them without the client ever touching keychain internals.

### `--status`: the disk-verified state query

```
otp --status <contact> [--porcelain]     (or -st)
```

Reports both directions of one contact, **verified from the disk files themselves** rather than trusting any single record. The key file's physical size is the authority on remaining key (bytes are consumed from the front and the file truncated - exactly the rule the operations themselves use); the `.meta` declarations are cross-checked against it; pending artifacts are classified by the very same truth-table code crash recovery runs (`commit_classify()` shares it with `commit_reconcile()`), so the report can never disagree with what the next operation will actually do.

Porcelain output is stable `key=value` lines:

```
contact=bob
enc_sequence=3                  # messages sent so far
enc_key_remaining=1048218       # physical key file size - the authority
enc_meta_state=consistent       # consistent | meta_behind | rolled_back
enc_redelivery_pending=0        # 1: next --encrypt redelivers a recovered message
enc_ack_outstanding=1           # 1: last sent message awaits delivery confirmation
dec_sequence=1
dec_key_remaining=1048476
dec_meta_state=consistent
dec_redelivery_pending=0
dec_ack_outstanding=0
```

Exit codes (most actionable condition across both directions, most severe first):

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Clean and ready in both directions |
| `4` | Redelivery pending: the next operation in some direction will re-emit a committed message from an interrupted run and will not process its input |
| `5` | Delivery confirmation outstanding: pass `-y` on the next operation once confirmed, or recover the copy |
| `6` | Key material rolled back (key file larger than the metadata records): its leading bytes were already spent once - re-key the contact |
| `1` | Error (unknown contact, unreadable key file) |

`--status` is strictly **read-only**: it never deletes, truncates, renames or heals anything - not even the staging-file sweep or the `meta_behind` self-correction, which stay in the operational paths. The keychain directory is byte-identical before and after (the test suite asserts this), the only files it may create being the ones every command creates on first touch: `.keychain/` itself and the contact's empty `.lock`, which it holds briefly so the snapshot cannot interleave with a live operation.

### `--recover-last`: re-emitting the kept safety copies

```
otp --recover-last <contact> --sent       (or -rl)   # exact ciphertext of the last encrypt
otp --recover-last <contact> --received              # exact plaintext of the last decrypt
```

Streams the kept safety copy to stdout. `--sent` is the client's re-transmission source when the transport lost a message (the same bytes are always valid for the receiver's current key position - **never re-encrypt**); `--received` recovers the plaintext when the client crashed between decrypting and handing the message to its application - the key bytes that produced it are already destroyed, so this copy is the only decryption that will ever exist.

Read-only and idempotent: the copy is **never** deleted by this command - not even after a fully successful stream, because bytes leaving the process are not proof they were persisted or delivered anywhere. The one deletion path is unchanged: the next operation in that direction removes the copy when the operator (or the client, via `-y`) confirms delivery. Exit codes: `0` copy streamed, `2` no copy exists (nothing awaits confirmation - usable as a cheap existence probe), `1` error.

### The integration flow

The client owns two things `otp` by design cannot: the transport ack (any application-level "got message N intact" reply from the peer) and the decision to pass `-y`, which that ack licenses. Everything else comes from disk:

```
                         SENDER (per contact)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ otp --status bob --porcelain                                     │
│   exit 4 (enc_redelivery_pending=1)?                             │

│       otp --recover-last bob --sent > out.bin                    │
│       re-transmit the SAME bytes (never re-encrypt), wait ack    │
│   exit 0 (clean, or ack now in hand)?                            │
│     → otp -c bob --encrypt -y < plain > out.bin                  │
│       exit 0: transmit; keep a copy until acked                  │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

│       deliver to the app, send ack; then continue below          │

│                                        decrypt and delivery;     │

│       exit 1: out-of-order/duplicate - key NOT spent; hold it    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The steady-state happy path collapses to `--status` (exit `0`) → operation with `-y` → transmit/deliver → ack. The other branches are the recovery ladder, each answerable from the status fields alone - so the client needs **no persistent state of its own** beyond its un-acked ciphertext copies, and even losing those is covered by `--recover-last --sent`.

### Why this flow preserves the one-time-pad guarantees

Requirement 2 of the pad - every key byte used exactly once, ever ([One Time Pad algorithm requirements](#one-time-pad-algorithm-requirements)) - and its transport corollary - each direction's messages decrypted in order, complete, exactly once - survive this flow untouched, for four reasons:

- **The query commands cannot spend or expose key.** Neither reads a single byte of key material; they read sizes, names and the kept payload copies. Every guard in the write paths - staging, CRC read-back verification, atomic publish, key-file-before-metadata ordering, the reconciliation truth table, the per-contact `flock()`, the fail-closed confirmation gate - runs unchanged, because that code is not modified, only queried.
- **Re-transmission never re-encrypts.** A lost message is re-sent from the stored ciphertext (the client's copy or `--recover-last --sent`), so no second key range is ever spent on the same plaintext, and the receiver's key position stays aligned whether the original or the retry arrives.
- **Redelivery is surfaced before it happens.** Exit `8` already prevented a script from mistaking a recovered message for its own; `redelivery_pending` lets the client know *in advance* that its input will not be processed, so it sequences the recovered message first and its new message second - preserving in-order, exactly-once within the direction.
- **The confirmation gate keeps its meaning.** `-y` remains an assertion the *client* makes from its own ack state, exactly as the interactive "yes" is the operator's. `--status` merely tells the client that the assertion is due (`ack_outstanding=1`); it never makes it. A client that follows the flow - ack before `-y`, `-y` before new key is spent - gives the gate strictly better information than an interactive user guessing from memory.

And the crash-safety picture is provably unchanged: `--status` and `--recover-last` are asserted read-only by the test suite (byte-identical keychain before and after, pending artifacts left untouched), the classification they report is the same code recovery executes, and every pre-existing crash-window, locking, metadata and confirmation test passes unmodified.

## Testing the implementation

### Running the automated tests

The suite lives in `test/`, one `.sh` script per area (key generation, keychain management, commit staging, locking, metadata, delivery confirmation, last-copy recovery, truncation handling, `--status`, `--recover-last`). Every script talks to a real `./bin/otp` binary over real files - there are no mocks of the disk or the keychain.

```
make build
```
Builds `bin/otp` and then runs every test script in sequence via `sh`, stopping at the first failure.

A single script can also be run directly once the binary is built, e.g.:

```
make build
bash test/otp.test.sh
```

`test/report.sh` runs the same scripts (continuing past failures so the run is always complete) and autogenerates `test-report.html` in the current directory: one expandable, colored PASS/FAIL section per script, with its captured output and its own source alongside. It's regenerated fresh on each run, so it always reflects the most recent results, never a stale copy:

```
make build
sh test/report.sh
```

`test-report.html` also ships inside each release's `.tar.gz` alongside the `otp` binary and the man page, so every release carries the full PASS/FAIL report it was built and tested against.

### Debugging logic in gdb

For anything the test output alone doesn't explain, stepping through the real C code in `gdb` is the fastest way to see what a given run actually did with the key material.

**Compile with debug symbols.** The release build in the `Makefile` uses `-O2`, which reorders and inlines code enough to make single-stepping confusing. Build a separate debug binary instead, straight from the sources `make build` compiles:

```
gcc -g -O0 -Wall -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -o bin/otp-debug src/cli.c src/keychain.c src/cipher.c src/commit.c
```

Run `gdb` against `bin/otp-debug` from the repo root so relative paths (`.keychain/`, key directories) resolve the way they would for a normal `otp` invocation.

#### Example: key generation

`-nk`/`--new-key-pair` is handled inline in `main()` (`src/cli.c`), which streams the pad out to disk through `keypair_stream_pad()`. Break there to watch each chunk get written and `fsync`'d:

```
$ gdb --args bin/otp-debug --new-key-pair 1 alice bob
(gdb) break keypair_stream_pad
(gdb) run < /dev/urandom
Breakpoint 1, keypair_stream_pad (buf=..., size=1048576, ...) at src/cli.c:226
226       size_t left = size;
(gdb) next
(gdb) print size
(gdb) continue
```

Stepping through `keypair_stream_pad()` shows the read-from-stdin / write-to-file loop and the spinner tick that reports progress; `next`-ing past the loop a few times and inspecting `left` shows the pad size counting down to zero across the two `_keys/` directories it writes (`alice_keys/`, `bob_keys/`).

#### Example: encryption / decryption

Both directions run through `src/cipher.c`. Set up a contact first so there is key material to consume:

```
$ cat /dev/urandom | bin/otp-debug --new-key-pair 1 alice bob
$ bin/otp-debug -ac alice alice_keys/encryption_for_bob.key alice_keys/decryption_from_bob.key
```

The XOR itself is one step in a longer pipeline - keychain lookup and locking, crash reconciliation, commit staging, atomic publish, key truncation, then metadata commit - covered end to end in [Crash-safe key consumption](#crash-safe-key-consumption). Breaking on each stage in order shows the whole thing happening, not just the cipher.

**Encrypt** - `encrypt_with_contact()` (`src/cipher.c:1024`) does the keychain part, then hands off to `encrypt_with_contact_locked()` (`src/cipher.c:719`) for reconciliation, staging and commit:

```
$ echo "hello bob" | gdb --args bin/otp-debug -c alice --encrypt
(gdb) break encrypt_with_contact
(gdb) break contact_lock_acquire
(gdb) break commit_reconcile
(gdb) break commit_stage_open
(gdb) break cipher.c:894
(gdb) break commit_stage_close_verified
(gdb) break commit_publish
(gdb) break truncate_key_file
(gdb) break save_contact_meta
(gdb) run
```

Stepping through with repeated `continue` hits each breakpoint in the order the code actually runs them:

1. `encrypt_with_contact` - `print contact_name`, `next` past `find_contact()` and `get_keychain_dir()` to see `c` and `keychain_dir` resolved from the keychain on disk.
2. `contact_lock_acquire` - the per-contact `flock()` on `<contact>.lock` that serializes this run against any other process touching the same contact (see [Per-contact locking](#per-contact-locking)); `finish` to return into `encrypt_with_contact`, where `load_keychain()` + `find_contact()` reload `c` fresh now that the lock is held.
3. `commit_reconcile` - runs before anything is spent, to finish or discard any pending artifact an earlier crashed run left behind; `print rec.action` after `finish` shows which of the truth-table outcomes applied (almost always none, on a clean run).
4. `commit_stage_open` - opens the durable per-process staging file (`<contact>_enc_pending.<pid>.tmp`) that the ciphertext is about to be streamed into; `print stage.tmp_path`.
5. `cipher.c:894` (`chunk[i] ^= key_chunk[i];`) - the actual cipher, one buffered chunk at a time: `print chunk[i]`, `print key_chunk[i]`, `next`, `print chunk[i]` shows the plaintext byte turning into ciphertext in place.
6. `commit_stage_close_verified` - `fsync`s the staged file and reads it back to confirm every byte landed correctly before anything is published.
7. `commit_publish` - atomically renames the verified stage file to its final, key-range-tagged name (`print final_path`); this is the first durably-visible evidence of the message, still independent of key consumption.
8. `truncate_key_file` - re-stages and republishes the encryption key file itself with the consumed bytes cut off the front; this is the moment the spent key range is physically destroyed.
9. `save_contact_meta` - commits the updated sequence number, offset and remaining size to `<contact>.meta`, the second and final half of the two-phase commit; `print c->EncryptionKeyOffset` shows the new range start.

`bt` at any of these shows the call stack back to `main()`'s `-c ... --encrypt` handling in `src/cli.c`.

**Decrypt** - the mirror image. `decrypt_with_contact()` (`src/cipher.c:1369`) → `decrypt_with_contact_locked()` (`src/cipher.c:1082`) follow the identical stage order, just against the decryption key: `commit_reconcile` (`src/cipher.c:1093`), `commit_stage_open` (`:1199`), the XOR at `cipher.c:1243`, `commit_stage_close_verified` (`:1282`), `commit_publish` (`:1308`), `truncate_key_file` (`:1319`), `save_contact_meta` (`:1335`):

```
$ gdb --args bin/otp-debug -c alice --decrypt
(gdb) break decrypt_with_contact
(gdb) break commit_reconcile
(gdb) break cipher.c:1243
(gdb) break truncate_key_file
(gdb) break save_contact_meta
(gdb) run
```
(feed it the ciphertext produced above, e.g. by redirecting the earlier run's stdout into this one's stdin)

The same nine-stage shape applies: keychain lookup and lock, reconcile, stage, XOR (`ciphertext ^ key = plaintext` this time), verify, publish, truncate the decryption key, commit metadata - with the same key bytes never read twice in either direction.
