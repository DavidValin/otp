//
// 1. Concurrent invocations. Two processes appending at once could
//    otherwise interleave their writes - flock()'d exclusively via the
//    same per-name lock contact operations use (contact_lock_acquire),
//    just keyed by the vault's own name instead of a contact's.
//
// 2. A short read from stdin (the randomness source died, was piped from
//    a file smaller than claimed, or was killed mid-stream). The incoming
//    bytes are staged into a tmp file and read-back verified via
//    commit_stage_close_verified() *before* the vault is touched at all -
//    so a caller who never supplies the full `size` bytes leaves the
//    vault exactly as it was, never partially appended.
//
// Once the new bytes are confirmed durable and complete, folding them
// into the vault is a plain O_APPEND copy - cheap (proportional to the
// new data, not the vault's total size) and, unlike the truncate-and-
// rewrite treatment key files get, safe to do in place: appending can
// only ever extend the file, never rewrite bytes already durable there,
// so even a failure partway through this last step cannot corrupt
// pre-existing vault content - it can at worst leave the new addition
// incomplete, which a later call simply appends past.
//
// On success, *out_total_size (if non-NULL) is set to the vault's total
// size after this call: for a brand-new vault, the exact count of bytes
// just staged; for an existing one, a fresh stat() of the vault itself

// must never suffer. Refusing here is the only point at which this is
// cheaply detectable; afterwards the two copies are independent files and
// nothing distinguishes them from a legitimately distinct pair.
//
// Compared by content rather than by path: a copy (cp k.bin k2.bin) is
// exactly as dangerous as passing the same filename twice, and a path
// comparison would miss it, as would an inode comparison.
//
// Equal size is NOT a precondition for danger, so it is not used as a
// shortcut. Key material here is consumed from the front and the file is
// truncated, so the natural leftover of this tool - a partially consumed
// key from .keychain/ - is a *suffix* of the pad it came from. Handing
// over a pad and its own leftover is overlap just as total as handing
// over the same file twice, and the sizes differ precisely because some
// of it was already spent. A truncated head of a pad is the mirror image
// of that case.
//
// Nor is overlap confined to those two alignments: a pad trimmed at both
// ends, or two windows cut from the same pad, share key material without
// either file being a prefix or suffix of the other. Detection therefore
// searches for each file's opening KEY_ANCHOR_LEN bytes at *every* offset
// of the other file, with a rolling hash so the search is one sequential
// read of each file. Any overlap that includes either file's first
// KEY_ANCHOR_LEN bytes is found this way; only an overlap that excludes
// both files' heads (which no artifact of this tool produces - every
// truncation preserves one end) or one shorter
// than the anchor can escape. Files smaller than the anchor keep the two
// aligned comparisons only: a handful of bytes genuinely can coincide in
// two independent pads, and refusing on such a coincidence would reject
// legitimate keys.
//
// The cost is a full read of both files rather than the early-exit a
// front-only comparison would allow. Adding a contact is rare and this is

// The spent-heads registry: <keychain_dir>/spent_heads

// Removing a contact deletes its key files, so nothing remains for the
// overlap check above to compare a later candidate against - which is
// exactly how a partially spent ORIGINAL key file could come back under a
// brand-new contact name and restart at offset 0 over bytes that already
// encrypted messages. The registry closes that hole: the first time a
// key's opening bytes are about to be consumed, two 64-bit digests of its
// first KEY_ANCHOR_LEN bytes are appended here, and every future add
// scans its candidate files for any registered head at any offset. The
// original always contains its own spent head, so it is recognized no
// matter what the contact is now called; the legitimately reusable
// remainder no longer contains it, so it still passes.
//
// Only digests are stored, never key bytes. This is still a deliberate,
// documented trade-off rather than a free lunch: a digest of spent pad
// bytes is a confirmation oracle - someone who reads this file AND holds
// a captured ciphertext can *verify a complete guess* of that message's
// first KEY_ANCHOR_LEN plaintext bytes. It recovers nothing by itself,
// and anyone able to read .keychain/ already holds every live key in it,
// which is strictly worse. The alternative - no durable trace - is the
// silent two-time pad this registry exists to prevent.
//
// Entries are one line each, "v1 <enc|dec> <rolling-hash> <confirm-hash>",
// appended and fsynced. The direction matters when a match is judged: a
// candidate DECRYPTION key containing an ENC-spent head is the mirrored
// other-endpoint pattern (it will decrypt exactly the messages those
// bytes already encrypted) and is only warned about; every other pairing
// means the same pad would cover two different messages and is refused.
