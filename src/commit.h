 * disk against `data`. On any failure the tmp file is removed and -1 is
 * returned; the caller must not proceed to commit_publish(). On success
 * the verified file is left at `tmp_path`, not yet published.

 * would be wasteful. A CRC32 is accumulated while writing, then
 * recomputed from a fresh read-back and compared.

 * to the real output stream is the one step this tool cannot make atomic (it
 * doesn't control what's on the other end of stdout), key consumption is
 * anchored to this durable local copy instead - once it exists and is
 * verified, delivery becomes a separate, freely-retryable, idempotent
 * step that never needs to touch key material again.
